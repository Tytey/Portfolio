<!-- 
wow your actually looking at the source file
I mean I told you to but if you actually are your checking good job
The truth is this probably isnt very well built 
I havent been coding for an insane amount of time but im passionate about coding
Thats why im doing this
Im building something that I didnt need to build to show that I can
This wasnt a prompt put into AI
This was code built on my prebuilt pc in my uni room using my brain
Anyways enjoy poking around - ill try comment stuff for the sake of it

<!--I was told to use these html and body tags as "good practive"-->
<html>

<!--script and style references-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/base.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="home.css">

<body>

    <!--
    Doing the style this way is a pain in the ass
    I mean surely it would be quicker to just do it all inline or in the same file??
    update: I am gonna use inline stuff because not doing allat!!!!
