<!-- 
wow your actually looking at the source file
I mean I told you to but if you actually are your checking good job
The truth is this probably isnt very well built 
I havent been coding for an insane amount of time but im passionate about coding
Thats why im doing this
Im building something that I didnt need to build to show that I can
This wasnt a prompt put into AI
This was code built on my prebuilt pc in my uni room using my brain
Anyways enjoy poking around - ill try comment stuff for the sake of it
Also side note this is my first proper time using git as im building it on my pc and laptop

    Doing the style this way is a pain in the ass

    update: I am gonna use inline stuff because not doing allat!!!!
